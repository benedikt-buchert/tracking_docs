<Admonition type="caution" title="Prefer JSON for Descriptions">

Whenever possible, keep descriptions and other schema-related information within the JSON schema file itself.

**Why?** This ensures that the schema is a single, self-contained source of truth. It makes the schema more portable and easier to use with other tools that might not be aware of these documentation partials.
